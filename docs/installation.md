# Installation

## Requirements

Knox depends on `cryptography` to provide bindings to `OpenSSL` for token generation
This requires the OpenSSL build libraries to be available.

### Windows
Cryptography is a statically linked build, no extra steps are needed

### Linux
`cryptography` should build very easily on Linux provided you have a C compiler,
headers for Python (if youâ€™re not using `pypy`), and headers for the OpenSSL and
`libffi` libraries available on your system.

Debian and Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev python-dev
```

Fedora and RHEL-derivatives:
```bash
sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel
```
For other systems or problems, see the [cryptography installation docs](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/)

## Installing Knox
Knox should be installed with pip

```bash
pip install django-rest-knox
```

Add `rest_framework` and `knox` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
  ...
  'rest_framework',
  'knox',
  ...
)
```

Remember to apply the migrations for the models

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
